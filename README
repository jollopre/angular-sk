folder, i.e. angular-sk where package.json is placed.

- In order to install dependencies for an angularJS app type:
	npm install [--production]	(--production will install dependencies to run an angularJS app ONLY)

	npm run start-server (server listening in  http://localhost:3000/app/index.html). Note this command is not needed if you have already a server hosting this app.

	npm run <script_name> (available scripts are under scripts key from package.json).

	npm run start-webdriver
